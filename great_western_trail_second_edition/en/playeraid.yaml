          1. Place the game board in the middle of the table.

          2. Shuffle the 9 station master tiles and place 5 of them at random
             on the 5 station master spaces.  Return the remaining 4 tiles to
             the box.

          3. Take the 7 neutral building tiles and place one face up onto each
             of the 7 neutral spaces on the game board (marked A to G).

          4. Place the job market token onto the top dashed round space in the
             job market.

          5. Sort the worker, outlaw and hazard tiles by the number on their
             back, and put them into their corresponding bags.  Place these
             bags near the board to create the Kansas City Supply.

              [SOLO: After shuffling, randomly draw one (2) tile and put it next
              to the game board.]!red!

          6. Draw 7 tiles from the (1) bag, and place them on the game board:

              * Outlaw tiles (orange and green) go onto the empty space with
                the lowest number (1 to 9) in the outlaw section.

              * Hazard tiles (flood, drought and rockfall) go onto the empty
                space with the lowest number (1 to 4) in the corresponding
                hazard section. If there are no more empty spaces in that
                section, return the tile to the bag and draw a new one.

          7. Draw tiles from the (2) bag to populate the job market.  Start
             with the top row, placing the first tile drawn onto the space
             directly beneath the player count sign matching the actual
             player count.  Fill the top row, and start again on the second
             row, filling all but the space with the job market token.

              When finished, there will be 3/5/7 workers for a 2/3/4 player
             game.

          8. Fill the 6 foresight spaces in Kansas City by drawing 2 tiles
             from each bag and placing them face up onto the spaces matching
             the bag number.

          9. Shuffle the 36 market cattle cards, and place them as a face-down
             market cattle stack near the board.  Draw 7/10/13 cards for a
             2/3/4 player game, and sort them by color, in this order.
              yellow, red, blue, brown, purple

          10. Shuffle the 24 objective cards and place them as a face-down
             stack near the board. Reveal the first 4 cards and display them
             face up in a column below the stack.

          11. Place the coins and exchange tokens within reach of all players.

          12. Each player chooses a player color, and takes the player board
              matching that color. If playing with 2 or 3 players, also take
              a player count tile of your color, turn it to the appropriate
              side, and overlay it onto the Phase A area of your board.

              [SOLO: Choose a color for Sam, but take Sam's board instead
              of a player board.]!red!

          13. Take the 12 private building tiles of your color.  Determine
              whether to use the "a" or "b" side of each tile. You may
              wish to sort them by required builders.

               **IMPORTANT:** All players should use the same configuration
              of tiles. IE, all players should use either 7a or 7b, etc.

               [SOLO: Sam will use the "b" side of all buildings, regardless
              of what side the human player uses.]!red!

               [Place the (2) tile set aside in step 5, and place it
              face-up into the leftmost pace of Sam's board matching the
              worker type.  If playing on Hard difficulty, take 1 of each
              worker type from the (2) bag and also add them to Sam's
              board.]!red!

               [Insert the specialization tile on Sam's board next to the
              most numerour worker type on the board.]!red!

          14. Take the 14 discs, engine, certificate marker, and herder
              matching your color:

               * Place the discs on your player board in the marked spaces.
               * Place the engine on the starting space of the railroad track.
               * Place the certificate marker in the top space of your
                 certificate track.
               * Place your herder near your board for now.

               [SOLO: Place Sam's engine on the starting space of the
              railroad track, his herder on the horseman space in the
              bottom left corner of the board, and the 14 discs near Sam's
              board. Sam does not use the certificate marker.]!red!

          15. Take the 14 player cattle cards matching your color, shuffle
              them, and place them face-down to the left of your player board.

               [SOLO: Sam does not use player cattle cards. Instead, shuffle
              Sam's cards and place them face-down near Sam's board.]!red!

          16. Shuffle the 4 starting objective cards and deal one at random
              to each player, returning the unused starting objective cards
              to the box.

               [SOLO: Deal Sam a starting objective card face-down near
              his board.]!red!

          17. Randomly determine a starting player, and receive your starting
              money, cards and tokens as follows:

               * 1st player: 6 dollars, 4 cards, 1 exchange token
               * 2nd player: 7 dollars, 5 cards, 1 exchange token
               * 3rd player: 8 dollars, 6 cards, 1 exchange token
               * 4th player: 9 dollars, 7 cards, 1 exchange token.

               **IMPORTANT:** On each player's first turn, discard down to 4
              cards and place your herder onto any neutral building (even one
              occupied by another player's herder).  Skip Phase A and go
              directly to Phase B.

               [SOLO: You are the first player. Sam does not receive any
              starting money, cards or tokens.]!red!

        - name: Phase A - Move your Herder
          text: |
              [SOLO: Draw a Sam card.]!red!

               Move your herder a number of steps based on your current step
              limit. This begins at 3 or 4, but can be increased if discs
              are removed from the Phase A section of your board.

               If a trail is forked, you may choose which fork to use.

               You must end your movement if you reach Kansas City.

               You do not need to use your full movement; you can stop at
              any step along the way. You must move at least 1 step.

               A step is any space with a building, hazard, or outlaw in it.

               If you enter or pass over a location with a black or green
              hand, you must pay a fee, based on the amount shown on your
              player board. If the hand is on a hazard or outlaw tile, you
              pay the fee to the bank. If it on another player's building,
              you pay the fee to that player. Ignore hands on buildings
              that are yours.  If you do not have enough money to pay the
              fee, you are not blocked from moving, but instead pay as much
              as you can and continue moving (if desired).

               [SOLO: Sam will always attempt to use the shortest path
              possible, using the movement value showing on his card.
              If tied, Sam will use the path with the lowest cost.
              If still tied, Sam will use the path that will pay the player
              the least amount of money. Any money payed to the player by
              Sam comes from the bank.]!red!

                    Either use the local actions of that tile or use one 
                    single auxiliary action on your player board.

                     Local actions are on the bottom of the building tile.
                    If two actions are separated by a white slash, you must
                    choose only one of them to resolve. Actions separated by
                    full dividers can each be resolved individually.

                     An Auxiliary action can only be performed once, even if
                    you have removed both discs for that action.

                text: |
                    You may only use a single auxiliary action on your player
                    board. You may only use the action once on this turn, even
                    if you have removed both discs for that action.

                text: |
                    [SOLO: Sam will take the action shown on the bottom of
                    his card, even if he reaches Kansas City. In that case,
                    resolve the action first, then resolve the Kansas City
                    process described below.]!red!

              - name: Kansas City
                text: |
                    If you reach Kansas City, you must carry out all the
                    following actions:

                    1. Foresight 1: Choose one of the tiles below spot 1
                       and move it to its corresponding section (hazard or
                       outlaw).

                        [SOLO: Sam will always choose the bottom tile.]!red!

                    2. Foresight 2: Choose one of the tiles below spot 2
                       and move it to the job market.

                        [SOLO: Sam will always choose the bottom tile.]!red!

                    3. Foresight 3: Choose one of the tiles below spot 3
                       and move it to its corresponding section (outlaw or
                       job market).

                        [SOLO: Sam will always choose the bottom tile.]!red!

                        **IMPORTANT** If placing a worker causes the job
                        market token to cross a yellow arrow, replenish the
                        cattle market by filling it to 7/10/13 cards (for
                        2/3/4 players), sorting it by yellow, red, blue,
                        brown and purple.

                    4. Income: Reveal your hand of cattle cards. Add up the
                       total value of each **different** type of cattle card
                       revealed to get your *breeding value*. If desired and
                       able, you can increase this value by using permanent
                       and temporary certificates.  Move the certificate
                       marker up on your board for each temporary certificate
                       used.

                        Gain a number of dollars from the bank equal to your
                       *breeding value*, and set it separately (to remind you
                       of your *breeding value* during Delivery).

                        Discard all revealed cards (even "duplicates" that
                       did not add to your breeding value).

                        [SOLO: Sam ignores this step.]!red!

                    5. Delivery: Choose a city whose value is equal to or
                       less than your final *breeding value*, and where you
                       do not already have a disc, and take a disc from your
                       player board and put it on the city space. 

                        * A disc from a space on your board with white 
                          corners can go on any city space.

                        * A disc from a space with a black corner may only
                          be placed on a city space with black corners.

                        You may deliver to Kansas City or New York City
                       any number of times, placing a disc on the city
                       each time.

                        If the city you are delivering to is farther along
                       the railroad track than your engine, you must pay
                       a number of dollars equal to the number of crosses
                       between your engine and the city. Pay this amount
                       to the bank. If the city is behind your engine, you
                       pay nothing.

                        If you place a disc on a city such that it is 
                       adjacent to another city with your disc, trigger the
                       delivery action in between those cities. If it is
                       victory points, those are scored at the end of the
                       game. Otherwise, draw an objective card from the
                       display, and replenish it. If you activate multiple
                       delivery actions, resolve them both, one at a time.

                        Finally, place your herder to the horeseman space
                       in the bottom left corner of the board, and
                       replenish the 3 vacant foresight spaces.

                        [SOLO: Sam will always place a discs on the next
                       available city, starting with the city listed in the
                       chosen difficulty. If this triggers a delivery action
                       to draw an objective card, take the card farthest from
                       the objective deck and place it near Sam's board.]!red!

              If you have fewer cards than your current hand limit, draw
              cards from your personal deck until you are back at your
              hand limit. If you need to draw a card and your deck is empty,
              then (and only then) reshuffle your discard pile to form a new
              deck.
