          If you see a number in A/B/C format, the number depends on the
          player count; ie, A for 2 players, B for 3 players, C for 4 players.
          
          1.  Place the **game board** in the middle of the table.
          2.  Shuffle the 9 **station master tiles**, placing one on each of
              the 5 *station master spaces*.  Return the remaining 4 to the
              box.
          3.  Take the 7 **neutral building tiles** and either place them
              on their corresponding *neutral spaces* on the board (recommended
              for the first game), or shuffle them and place them randomly.
          4.  Place the **job market token** on the top dasked round space
              on the *job market*.
          5.  Sort the **worker**, **hazard**, and **outlaw** tiles by the
              number on their back, and place them in their corresponding
              numbered *bags*.  These are the *Kansas City Supply*
          6.  Draw 7 tiles from the "1" bag of the Kansas City Supply, and
              place them on their corresponding spaces on the game board. Each
              tile should be placed in the lowest-numbered available space
              on its track.
               * Outlaws are placed on the outlaw track in the middle of the
                 board.
               * Hazards are placed on the matching hazard track (flood, 
                 drought, or rockfall).
              If a tile cannot be placed, return it to the bag and draw a
              new tile.
          7.  Draw 3/5/7 tiles from the "2" bag, and place
              them on the job market, starting from the top, going left to
              right. Only place tiles on spaces for the player count.
          8.  Fill the 6 *foresight* spaces in Kansas City by drawing 2 tiles
              each from the "1", "2" and "3" bags, and placing them on their
              respective spaces.
          9.  Shuffle the **market cattle cards** and draw 7/10/13 cards, 
              sorting them by color and placing them in this order: 
              [Yellow]!yellow!, [Red]!red!, [Blue]!blue!, [Brown]!brown!,
              [Purple]!purple!.
          10. Shuffle the **objective cards**, and place them near the game
              board. Draw 4 of these cards and place them a column beneath
              the deck.
          11. Place the **coins** and **exchange tokens** accessible to all
              players to form the supply.
          12. Each player chooses a player color, taking the **player board**
              for that color. If playing with 2 or 3 players, also take the 
              **player count** tile for the appropriate player count, using it
              to cover the *Phase A* section at the top of your player board.
          13. Each player takes the 12 **private building tiles** for your
              color. For the first game, use the "A" side for all buildings.
              In subsequent games, pick any mix of "A" and "B" sides using any
              method you desire. All players should use the same "A" and "B"
              sides for each building.
          14. Each player takes the other pieces of your player color:
               * 14 **discs**, placed to cover the marked spaces on your
                 player board.
               * 1 **engine**, placed on the starting space of the *railroad
                 track* on the game board.
               * 1 **certificate marker**, placed on the "0" space of the
                 certificate track on your player board.
               * 1 **herder**, placed next to your player board for now.
          15. Each player takes the 14 **player cattle cards** matching your
              color, shuffles them and places them in a deck near your
              player board.
          16. Shuffle the **starting objective cards** and deal one at random
              to each player, and is place face-up near your player board.
          17. Randomly determine a **starting player**. Starting with the 
              first player and proceeding clockwise, each player collects the
              specified number of coins and exchange tiles, and draws the
              specified number of cards from their cattle deck: 
               * 1st player: $6, 1 exchange tile, 4 cards
               * 2nd player: $7, 1 exchange tile, 5 cards
               * 3rd player: $8, 1 exchange tile, 6 cards
               * 4th player: $9, 1 exchange tile, 7 cards

              Before your first turn, if you have more than 4 cards, you must
              discard down to 4 cards.

          Beginning with the 1st player and proceding clockwise, each player
          takes their turn by resolving the following phases in order.

          * [Phase A - Move your herder](#phase_a)
          * [Phase B - Use actions of your location](#phase_b)
          * [Phase C - Draw up to your hand limit](#phase_c)

          Play continues until the **job marker** is moved off the bottom
          of the *job track*. Once this happens, the current player finishes
          their turn, then each **other** player takes one final turn.

          Then players should tally up their [final scores](#final_scoring).

          - name: Phase A - Move your herder
            id: phase_a
            text: |
                **NOTE: For your first turn of the game, instead of moving
                your herder, instead place your herder onto any *neutral*
                building on the board.  Also, don't forget to discard down
                to 4 cards if you started the game drawing more than 4.**

                Move your herder a number of steps up to your step limit.
                Your step limit starts at 3, but can be increased by removing
                discs from the Phase A section of your player board.  You 
                must move your herder at leats one step.

                Each step is either a building, a hazard tile, an outlaw
                tile, or Kansas City. If you reach Kansas City, you must
                end your movement.

                If your herder passes over a Hazard tile or another player's
                **private building** with a hand icon, you must pay a fee.
                The amount to be paid is shown in the Phase A section of your
                player board (or the player count tile).  If the hand is
                on a hazard, the fee is returned to the supply.  If the hand
                is on another player's private building, the fee is paid to 
                that player.  If you don't have enough money to pay the fee,
                you can continue moving, paying as much as you can; you do
                not have to "pay back" any missed fees later.  You also do
                not pay fees for your own private buildings.

                 * In a 2-player game, the fee is $2 for both hand colors.
                 * In a 3-player game, the fee is $2 for green hands, and $1
                   for black hands.
                 * In a 4-player game, the fee is $1 for green hands, and $2
                   for black hands.

            id: phase_b
            text: |
                Depending on your herder's location, the actions you resolve
                are as follows:

                1. A neutral building or a private building of your color:
                
                    Either use the [local actions](#local_actions) of the
                    building tile (including any risk actions associated with
                    the building's space), or take one [auxiliary action](#aux_actions).

                2. A private building of another player, a hazard tile, or an
                   outlaw tile:

                    Take one [auxiliary action](#aux_actions).

                3. Kansas City

                    Carry out the following sub-phases in order:

                    1. Foresight - Choose one of the "1" foresight tiles,
                       and place it on the lowest available space of the
                       relevant outlaw or hazard track.  Draw a new tile
                       from the "1" bag to replenish the foresight track.

                    2. Foresight - Choose one of the "2" foresight tiles,
                       and place it on the next available space of the job
                       market. If the tile would be place where the job
                       marker is, move the job marker down one space.
                       Draw a new tile from the "2" bag and replenisch the
                       foresignt track.

                         * If the job marker crosses a yellow arrow, refill
                           the cattle market to 7/10/13 cards, sorting them
                           by color as specified in the setup instructions.
                         * If the job marker moves off the bottom of the job
                           market, place the job marker near your player board.
                           After your turn is done, each other player will
                           get one additional turn.

                    3. Foresight - Choose one of the "3" foresight tiles,
                       and place it according to the rules listed above,
                       depending on the type of tile it is.  Draw a new tile
                       from the "3" bag and replenish the foresight track.

                    4. Income - Total the values shown on the top-right corner
                       of each **type** of cattle card in your hand.  This sum
                       is called your **breeding value**.  Only one card of
                       each type contributes to this value.

                        For each **permanent certificate** you have, incrase
                       the breeding value by one.  Then, you can spend any
                       number of **temporary certificates** by moving your
                       **certificate marker** up the track any number of
                       spaces and increasing your breeding value by that
                       amount.

                        Collect coins equal to the breeding value and set them
                       aside temporarily.

                        Discard all cards in your hand.

                    5. Delivery - Choose a city with a **city value** equal to
                       or less than your breeding value.  The chosen city cannot
                       already have one of your disks on it (except Kansas City
                       and New York City).  Take a disk from your player board
                       and it on the city space.  If the city space has black
                       corners, you may take the disk from anywhere on your
                       player board; otherwise, the disk must be taken from a
                       space on your player board with white corners only.

                          * If you take a disk from the Phase A space of your
                            player board that shows $3 above it, take $3 from
                            the bank.
                          * If you take a disk from the Phace C section of
                            your player, you must immediatly pay $5.  If you
                            do not have $5, you cannot take that disk.
                          * If you place the disk on Kansas City, immediately
                            gain $4.
                          * If you place a disk such that you now have disks
                            on both sides of a delivery action, you must now
                            immediately resolve it.  **TODO DELVIERY ACTIONS**

                        If the city you delivered to is farther along the 
                       railroad track than your engine, you must pay $1 to
                       the supply for each cross located between your engine
                       and the city. If your engine is at or beyond the city,
                       you do not have to pay anything.

                        Finally, take the money set aside, and move your herder
                       to the start space at the bottom-right of the board.
