          If you see a number in A/B/C format, the number depends on the
          player count; ie, A for 2 players, B for 3 players, C for 4 players.
          
          1.  Place the **game board** in the middle of the table.
          2.  Shuffle the 9 **station master tiles**, placing one on each of
              the 5 *station master spaces*.  Return the remaining 4 to the
              box.
          3.  Take the 7 **neutral building tiles** and either place them
              on their corresponding *neutral spaces* on the board (recommended
              for the first game), or shuffle them and place them randomly.
          4.  Place the **job market token** on the top dasked round space
              on the *job market*.
          5.  Sort the **worker**, **hazard**, and **outlaw** tiles by the
              number on their back, and place them in their corresponding
              numbered *bags*.  These are the *Kansas City Supply*
          6.  Draw 7 tiles from the "1" bag of the Kansas City Supply, and
              place them on their corresponding spaces on the game board. Each
              tile should be placed in the lowest-numbered available space
              on its track.
               * Outlaws are placed on the outlaw track in the middle of the
                 board.
               * Hazards are placed on the matching hazard track (flood, 
                 drought, or rockfall).
              If a tile cannot be placed, return it to the bag and draw a
              new tile.
          7.  Draw 3/5/7 tiles from the "2" bag, and place
              them on the job market, starting from the top, going left to
              right. Only place tiles on spaces for the player count.
          8.  Fill the 6 *foresight* spaces in Kansas City by drawing 2 tiles
              each from the "1", "2" and "3" bags, and placing them on their
              respective spaces.
          9.  Shuffle the **market cattle cards** and draw 7/10/13 cards, 
              sorting them by color and placing them in this order: 
              [Yellow]!yellow!, [Red]!red!, [Blue]!blue!, [Brown]!brown!,
              [Purple]!purple!.
          10. Shuffle the **objective cards**, and place them near the game
              board. Draw 4 of these cards and place them a column beneath
              the deck.
          11. Place the **coins** and **exchange tokens** accessible to all
              players to form the supply.
          12. Each player chooses a player color, taking the **player board**
              for that color. If playing with 2 or 3 players, also take the 
              **player count** tile for the appropriate player count, using it
              to cover the *Phase A* section at the top of your player board.
          13. Each player takes the 12 **private building tiles** for your
              color. For the first game, use the "A" side for all buildings.
              In subsequent games, pick any mix of "A" and "B" sides using any
              method you desire. All players should use the same "A" and "B"
              sides for each building.
          14. Each player takes the other pieces of your player color:
               * 14 **discs**, placed to cover the marked spaces on your
                 player board.
               * 1 **engine**, placed on the starting space of the *railroad
                 track* on the game board.
               * 1 **certificate marker**, placed on the "0" space of the
                 certificate track on your player board.
               * 1 **herder**, placed next to your player board for now.
          15. Each player takes the 14 **player cattle cards** matching your
              color, shuffles them and places them in a deck near your
              player board.
          16. Shuffle the **starting objective cards** and deal one at random
              to each player, and is place face-up near your player board.
          17. Randomly determine a **starting player**. Starting with the 
              first player and proceeding clockwise, each player collects the
              specified number of coins and exchange tiles, and draws the
              specified number of cards from their cattle deck: 
               * 1st player: $6, 1 exchange tile, 4 cards
               * 2nd player: $7, 1 exchange tile, 5 cards
               * 3rd player: $8, 1 exchange tile, 6 cards
               * 4th player: $9, 1 exchange tile, 7 cards

              Before your first turn, if you have more than 4 cards, you must
              discard down to 4 cards.

          Beginning with the 1st player and proceding clockwise, each player
          takes their turn by resolving the following phases in order.

          * [Phase A - Move your herder](#phase_a)
          * [Phase B - Use actions of your location](#phase_b)
          * [Phase C - Draw up to your hand limit](#phase_c)

          Play continues until the **job marker** is moved off the bottom
          of the *job track*. Once this happens, the current player finishes
          their turn, then each **other** player takes one final turn.

          Then players should tally up their [final scores](#final_scoring).
      sections:
          - name: Phase A - Move your herder
            id: phase_a
            text: |
                **NOTE: For your first turn of the game, instead of moving
                your herder, instead place your herder onto any *neutral*
                building on the board.  Also, don't forget to discard down
                to 4 cards if you started the game drawing more than 4.**

                Move your herder a number of steps up to your step limit.
                Your step limit starts at 3, but can be increased by removing
                discs from the Phase A section of your player board.  You 
                must move your herder at leats one step.

                Each step is either a building, a hazard tile, an outlaw
                tile, or Kansas City. If you reach Kansas City, you must
                end your movement.

                If your herder passes over a Hazard tile or another player's
                **private building** with a hand icon, you must pay a fee.
                The amount to be paid is shown in the Phase A section of your
                player board (or the player count tile).  If the hand is
                on a hazard, the fee is returned to the supply.  If the hand
                is on another player's private building, the fee is paid to 
                that player.  If you don't have enough money to pay the fee,
                you can continue moving, paying as much as you can; you do
                not have to "pay back" any missed fees later.  You also do
                not pay fees for your own private buildings.

                 * In a 2-player game, the fee is $2 for both hand colors.
                 * In a 3-player game, the fee is $2 for green hands, and $1
                   for black hands.
                 * In a 4-player game, the fee is $1 for green hands, and $2
                   for black hands.
          - name: Phase B - Use actions of your location
            id: phase_b
            text: |
                Depending on your herder's location, the actions you resolve
                are as follows:

                1. A neutral building or a private building of your color:
                
                    Either use the [local actions](#local_actions) of the
                    building tile (including any risk actions associated with
                    the building's space), or take one [auxiliary action](#aux_actions).

                2. A private building of another player, a hazard tile, or an
                   outlaw tile:

                    Take one [auxiliary action](#aux_actions).

                3. Kansas City

                    Carry out the following sub-phases in order:

                    1. Foresight - Choose one of the "1" foresight tiles,
                       and place it on the lowest available space of the
                       relevant outlaw or hazard track.  Draw a new tile
                       from the "1" bag to replenish the foresight track.

                    2. Foresight - Choose one of the "2" foresight tiles,
                       and place it on the next available space of the job
                       market. If the tile would be place where the job
                       marker is, move the job marker down one space.
                       Draw a new tile from the "2" bag and replenisch the
                       foresignt track.

                         * If the job marker crosses a yellow arrow, refill
                           the cattle market to 7/10/13 cards, sorting them
                           by color as specified in the setup instructions.
                         * If the job marker moves off the bottom of the job
                           market, place the job marker near your player board.
                           After your turn is done, each other player will
                           get one additional turn.

                    3. Foresight - Choose one of the "3" foresight tiles,
                       and place it according to the rules listed above,
                       depending on the type of tile it is.  Draw a new tile
                       from the "3" bag and replenish the foresight track.

                    4. Income - Total the values shown on the top-right corner
                       of each **type** of cattle card in your hand.  This sum
                       is called your **breeding value**.  Only one card of
                       each type contributes to this value.

                        For each **permanent certificate** you have, incrase
                       the breeding value by one.  Then, you can spend any
                       number of **temporary certificates** by moving your
                       **certificate marker** up the track any number of
                       spaces and increasing your breeding value by that
                       amount.

                        Collect coins equal to the breeding value and set them
                       aside temporarily.

                        Discard all cards in your hand.

                    5. Delivery - Choose a city with a **city value** equal to
                       or less than your breeding value.  The chosen city cannot
                       already have one of your discs on it (except Kansas City
                       and New York City).  Take a disc from your player board
                       and it on the city space.  If the city space has black
                       corners, you may take the disc from anywhere on your
                       player board; otherwise, the disc must be taken from a
                       space on your player board with white corners only.

                          * If you take a disc from the Phase A space of your
                            player board that shows $3 above it, take $3 from
                            the bank.
                          * If you take a disc from the Phace C section of
                            your player, you must immediatly pay $5.  If you
                            do not have $5, you cannot take that disc.
                          * If you place the disc on Kansas City, immediately
                            gain $4.
                          * If you place a disc such that you now have discs
                            on both sides of a delivery action, you must now
                            immediately resolve it.  **TODO DELVIERY ACTIONS**

                        If the city you delivered to is farther along the 
                       railroad track than your engine, you must pay $1 to
                       the supply for each cross located between your engine
                       and the city. If your engine is at or beyond the city,
                       you do not have to pay anything.

                        Finally, take the money set aside, and move your herder
                       to the start space at the bottom-right of the board.
            
          - name: Phase C - Draw up to your hand limit
            id: phase_c
            text: |
                Draw up to your hand limit. Your hand limit starts at 4, but
                can be increased by removing discs from the Phase C section
                of your player board. (Note that it costs $5 to remove those
                discs).

    - name: Final Scoring
      id: final_scoring
      text: |
          Using the scoring pad, calculate your final score by adding up
          your **victory points** (VP) in each of the following categories:

          1.  Gain 1 VP for every $5 you own. (eg, if you have $12, you will
              score 2 VP)
          2.  Gain the sum of the VP printed on each of your private building
              tiles on the board.
          3.  Gain the sum of VP that you have unlocked with your discs on
              city crests (ie, you have a disc on each side of them).  Some
              of these will be negative points.  Also subtract VP for each
              of your discs on Kansas City, and add VP for each of your discs
              on New York City.
          4.  Gain the sum of VP printed next to each train station that has
              your disc on it.
          5.  Gain the sum of VP printed on your collected hazard tiles.
          6.  Gain the sum of VP printed on any cattle cards in your hand, 
              discard pile, and draw stack.
          7.  Find any objective cards still in your hand, discard pile, or
              draw stack. Remove any of these from the game that you wish,
              and put the rest into your play area.  Then, for each objective
              in your play area (including those played earlier), either gain
              the positive VP printed on the card (if you meet the tasks for
              that objective), or lose the negative VP printed on the card
              (if you do not).  Remember, each card must have its tasks
              fulfilled separately.  For example, a single collected Outlaw
              tile cannot be used to fulfil two separate Outlas tasks.
          8.  Gain the sum of VP generated by the tasks on station master tiles
              you have collected. The tasks on these tiles are independent of
              the tasks for scoring objective. For instance, an Outlaw tile
              can be used to fulfil an objective task, as well as a station
              master tile task.
          9.  Gain 4 VP for each worker placed on the 5th or 6th space of your
              player board.
          10. Gain 3 VP if you removed the disc with the VP badge in the Phase
              1 section of your player board.
          11. Gain 2 VP if you claimed the job market tile.

           Whoever has the most total VP wins the game. If tied, the tied players
          share the victory.

            id: local_actions
            text: |
                Below is a description of the various actions you may find.
                If the game piece shows two actions separated by a slash, you
                choose **one** of those actions to resolve.

                - Discarding actions: Discard the item shown with a red arrow
                  to gain the reward listed next to it. If there is a +
                  between the rewards, you gain both rewards.
                    - Certificate: Move your certificate marker one space down.
                    - Coin: Gain the specified number of dollars.
                    - Train: Move your engine the specified number of spaces forward
                      (green arrow) or backward (red arrow).
                
                - Hire one worker: Hire a worker from the job market by paying
                  the cost next to that worker's row, then place the worker in
                  the left-most available spot on the related row of your player
                  board. If there is a coin with a number next to the worker
                  icon on the action:
                    
                      - Red (negative) number: You must spend this many additional
                        dollars to hire the worker.
                      - Green (positive) number: You spend this many fewer dollars
                        to hire the worker.

                   If you already have 6 workers of a particular type, you cannot
                  hire more workers of that type.

                  If you place a worker onto a space that has an immediate action,
                  you must either immediately perform that action or forfeit it.
                
                - Buy cattle from the cattle market: Use your cowboys to buy cattle
                  cards from the cattle market, as described below.  You can also
                  use any number of your cowboys to draw 2 additional cattle cards
                  from the market cattle stack and add them to the market at any
                  time during this action.  Each cowboy can only be used once per
                  action.

                      - Use 1 cowboy to buy one cattle card with a breeding value of 3 
                        for $6 **or** buy one "Shorthorn" cattle card for $12.
                      - Use 2 cowboys to buy one cattle card with a breeding value
                        of 3 for $3 **or** buy one "Hereford" cattle card for $12
                      - Use 3 cowboys to buy two cattle cards each with a breeding
                        value of 3 for a total of $5 **or** buy one "Shorthorn"
                        cattle card for $6
                      - Use 4 cowboys to buy one "Hereford" cattle card for $6
                      - Use 5 cowboys to buy two "Shorthorn" cattle cards for a
                        total of $8.

                  Add any purchased cattle cards to your discard pile.
                 
                - Move your engine forward: Move your engine forward along the
                  track as many spaces as shown. If it shows an engineeer next to
                  it, move it one space for each engineer on your player board.
                  When moving your engine, you can move along a turnout space.
                  You can choose to move fewer spaces than allowed. If your
                  engine ends movement next to a train station, you must 
                  immediately decide whether to **upgrade** that train station.
                  To do this, pay the cost shown next to the station, and place
                  a disc from your player board (paying attention to the color
                  of the corners).
                  
                   If there is a station master tile, you may
                  also choose to take it and put it in your play area; if you
                  do, you must take one of your workers from your board and
                  place it where the station master tile was. The worker used
                  must be the right-most worker for that row on your board.
                  If the station master tile has an immediate effect, resolve it
                  now.

                   If your engine reaches the last space of the railroad track,
                  it must end its movement there (and you can upgrade the
                  train station if you wish). Then, you must move your 
                  engine at least one space backward (but can move it to any
                  free space on the track, even a turnout space). Then gain $3.
                  If you move your engine to a train station, you may choose
                  to upgrade it immediately, using the $3 you just received if
                  you want.

                - Gain one objective card: Choose one of the 4 face-up objective
                  cards or draw the top objective card from the deck. Place this
                  card in your discard pile.

                   If you have an objective card in your hand on your turn, you
                  can play it before Phase A, or before or after any action in
                  phase B (but not during Phase C). Place the objective card in
                  your play area, and gain the immediate action shown at the 
                  top-left of the card. If you do this, you must fulfil the
                  tasks shown on the card at the end of the game, or lose VP.

                - Place one of your private buildings: Choose a private building
                  that you have not yet used, and either place it onto an **empty**
                  *building space* on the board, or **replace** one of your
                  previously placed building tiles on the board. You must have
                  enough builders and be able to pay the cost.

                   The number of builders required is shown in the top-left corner
                  of the building tile. When placing a new building, you must
                  have at least that many builders on your player board. If
                  replacing an existing building, you must have at least as many
                  builders as the *difference* between the new building and the
                  previous one. If the new building requires fewer workers, then
                  you can always place it.

                   For each builder used, you must also pay $2.

                - Perform one single or double [auxiliary action](#aux_actions).

                - Collect bounty for outlaws: Remove one outlaw tile of your choice
                  from the board, and collect the reward shown above that tile. You
                  do not have to choose the "highest" outlaw tile. You cannot 
                  perform this action if there are no outlaws on the board. Place
                  the chosen tile near your player board.

                - Gain an exchange token: Gain an exchange token from the supply.
                  Exchange tokens can be spent at **any time** to draw up to 2 
                  cards from your personal stack, then discard the same number
                  of cards.

                - Remove a hazard: Remove one hazard tile of your choice from any
                  hazard section and place it near your player board. If the action
                  shows a cost next to it, you must pay the cost before taking
                  the hazard tile.

                - Move your herder forward: Move your herder at least 1 step and
                  not more than the number shown on the action. After moving,
                  you must then perform the steps of Phase B again.
