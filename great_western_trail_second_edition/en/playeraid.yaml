          If you see a number in A/B/C format, the number depends on the
          player count; ie, A for 2 players, B for 3 players, C for 4 players.
          
          1.  Place the **game board** in the middle of the table.
          2.  Randomly place 5 **station master tiles** on the 
              *station master spaces*.
          3.  Place the 7 **neutral building tiles** on the A-F spaces of the board.
          4.  Place the **job market token** on the top dasked round space
              on the *job market*.
          5.  Place the **worker**, **hazard**, and **outlaw** tiles in the bags
              incidated by their backs.
          6.  Draw 7 tiles from the **"1" bag** and place them on the corresponding
              hazard or outlaw tracks (starting at lower numbered spaces).  Redraw
              any tiles that can't be placed.
          7.  Draw 3/5/7 tiles from the **"2 bag"** and place them on the job
              market, top to bottom, left to right, on spaces matching the player
              count. 
          8.  Draw 2 tiles from each bag and place them on their respective
              *foresight spaces*.
          9.  Shuffle the **market cattle cards** and draw 7/10/13 cards to form
              the market.  They should be sorted by color in this order:
              [Yellow]!yellow!, [Red]!red!, [Blue]!blue!, [Brown]!brown!,
              [Purple]!purple!.
          10. Shuffle the **objective cards**, and place them near the game
              board. Draw 4 of these cards and place them a column beneath
              the deck.
          11. Place the **coins** and **exchange tokens** into a supply.
          12. Each player chooses a player color, and takes the **player board**
              (and **player count tile**, if playing with 2 or 3 players) for the
              chosen color.
          13. Each player takes the 12 **private building tiles** of their color.
              Choose any mix of "A" or "B" sides for buildings; all players should
              use the same mix.
          14. Each player takes the other pieces of their color:
               * 14 **discs**, placed to cover the marked spaces on their player
                 board.
               * 1 **engine**, placed on the starting space of the *railroad
                 track* on the game board.
               * 1 **certificate marker**, placed on the "0" space of the
                 certificate track on their player board.
               * 1 **herder**, placed next to their player board for now.
          15. Each player takes the 14 **player cattle cards** matching their
              color, shuffles them and places them in a personal deck near their
              player board.
          16. Shuffle the **starting objective cards** and deal one at random
              to each player, placed face-up near their player board.
          17. Randomly determine a **starting player**. Starting with the 
              first player and proceeding clockwise, each player collects the
              specified number of dollars and exchange tiles, and draws the
              specified number of cards from their cattle deck: 
               * 1st player: $6, 1 exchange tile, 4 cards
               * 2nd player: $7, 1 exchange tile, 5 cards
               * 3rd player: $8, 1 exchange tile, 6 cards
               * 4th player: $9, 1 exchange tile, 7 cards

              Players drawing more than 4 cards should discard down to 4 prior
              to their first turn.

          Beginning with the 1st player and proceding clockwise, each player
          takes their turn by resolving the following phases in order.

          * [Phase A - Move your herder](#phase_a)
          * [Phase B - Use actions of your location](#phase_b)
          * [Phase C - Draw up to your hand limit](#phase_c)

          Play continues until the **job marker** is moved off the bottom
          of the *job track*. Once this happens, the current player finishes
          their turn, then each **other** player takes one final turn.

          Then players should tally up their [final scores](#final_scoring).
      sections:
          - name: Phase A - Move your herder
            id: phase_a
            text: |
                **NOTE: For your first turn, instead of moving your herder, 
                instead place it directly onto any *neutral building* on the
                board.**

                Move your herder a number of steps up to your step limit.
                Your step limit starts at 3, but can be increased by removing
                discs from the Phase A section of your player board. You 
                must move your herder at leats one step.

                A step is a building tile, hazard tile, outlaw tile, or 
                Kansas City. You must stop moving at Kansas City.

                Pay any fees for black and green hands shown on tiles you
                move onto or through; the amount paid is shown on your player
                board or player count tile.  Fees go to the player that own
                the private building, or to the supply for hazards and outlaws.
                Do not pay fees for your own buildings.
          - name: Phase B - Use actions of your location
            id: phase_b
            text: |
                Resolve actions based on where your herder ends its movement:

                1. A neutral building or a private building of your color:
                
                    Either use the [local actions](#local_actions) of the
                    building tile or take one single [auxiliary action](#aux_actions).

                2. A private building of another player, a hazard tile, or an
                   outlaw tile:

                    Take one single [auxiliary action](#aux_actions).

                3. Kansas City

                    Carry out the following sub-phases in order:

                    1. Foresight - choose a "1" foresight tile, and place
                       it on the appropriate place on the board.  Draw a new
                       "1" tile from the bag, and place it on the foresight
                       space.

                    2. Foresight - Same as above, but for the "2" foresight
                       space.

                    3. Foresight - Same as above, but for the "3" foresight
                       space.

                        If the job marker crosses a yellow arrow in steps 2 or
                       3, refill the cattle market to 7/10/13 cards, sorting 
                       them by color as in setup. If the job marker goes off
                       the bottom of the board, the current player takes it and
                       the end-game is triggered.

                    4. Income - Total the values at the top of each **type**
                       of cattle card in your hand as your **breeding value**.
                       Only one card of each type contributes to this total.
                       Increase this total for each **permanent certificate**
                       you own, and spend any number of **temporary certificates**
                       to increaset the total by that amount.

                        Collect dollars equal to the breeding value and set them
                       aside.

                        Discard your entire hand.

                    5. Delivery - Choose an accessible city (one whose city
                       value is not more than your breeding value). Only Kansas
                       City and New York City can have multiple discs. Take a
                       disc from your player board and place it on the city
                       crest. You can only take a disc from a black-cornered
                       spot of your board if the city crest also has black corners.

                           * Gain $3 if taken from the $3 spot of the Phase A
                             section of your board.
                           * Pay $5 if taken from one of the spaces in the 
                             Phase C section of your board.

                        Gain any immediate benefit by placing the disk, shown
                       on the city, or by placing a disc so both sides of a
                       green arrow have a disc.

                        Pay $1 for each cross between your engine and the city
                       if it is farther along the track than your engine.

                        Put the remaining set-aside money in your rupply, and
                       move your herder to the start space.

          - name: Phase C - Draw up to your hand limit
            id: phase_c
            text: |
                Draw up to your hand limit. This starts at 4, and can be
                increased for each Phase C disc taken from your player board.

    - name: Final Scoring
      id: final_scoring
      text: |
          Using the scoring pad, calculate your final score by adding up
          your **victory points** (VP) in each of the following categories:

          1.  Gain 1 VP for every $5 you own. (eg, if you have $12, you will
              score 2 VP)
          2.  Gain the sum of the VP printed on each of your private building
              tiles on the board.
          3.  Gain the sum of VP that you have unlocked with your discs on
              city crests, including positive and negative VP values.
          4.  Gain the sum of VP printed next to each train station that has
              your disc on it.
          5.  Gain the sum of VP printed on your collected hazard tiles.
          6.  Gain the sum of VP printed on any cattle cards in your hand, 
              discard pile, and draw stack.
          7.  Either play or remove any objective cards still in your hand,
              draw stack, or discard pile. For each objective played (either
              now or previously), gain the postiive VP value if you fulfiled all
              the tasks shown, or lose the negative VP value if you did not. 
              **Remember, each task must be met separately; the same item
              cannot be used to fulfill multiple tasks.**
          8.  Gain the sum of VP generated by station master tiles you collected.
              Items used to score objective tasks **can** be used to score 
              station master tiles.
          9.  Gain 4 VP for each worker placed on the 5th or 6th space of your
              player board.
          10. Gain 3 VP if you removed the disc with the VP badge in the Phase
              1 section of your player board.
          11. Gain 2 VP if you claimed the job market tile.

           Whoever has the most total VP wins the game. If tied, the tied players
          share the victory.

            text: |
                Below is a description of the more common actions you may find
                on building tiles. 

                 * Discarding actions: Discard the item shown with a red arrow
                   to gain the reward listed next to it. If there is a +
                   between the rewards, you gain both rewards.
            
                 * Hire one worker: Hire a worker from the job market by paying
                   the cost next to that worker's row, then place the worker on
                   your board. You must pay more (red number) or less (green number)
                   moeny if there is a coin icon next to the worker icon.

                    If you already have 6 workers of a particular type, you cannot
                   hire more workers of that type.

                    If you place a worker onto a space that has an immediate action,
                   you must either immediately perform that action or forfeit it.
                
                 * Buy cattle from the cattle market: Use your cowboys to
                   buy cattle from the market (using the key on the board for
                   details on cost). You can also use a single cowboy to add 2
                   more cattle to the cattle market.

                    Add any purchased cattle cards to your discard pile.
                
                 * Move your engine forward: Move your engine forward along the
                   track up to the specified number of spaces. Ignore spaces with
                   another player's engine. You can move along turnout spaces as
                   well.

                    If you end on a station space, you can upgrade the station by
                   paying the cost shown. If you do, and there is a station master
                   tile, you can take the tile by replacing it with a worker on
                   your player board; gain or forfeit any immediate reward shown
                   on the station space and/or station master tile.

                    If your engine reaches the end of the track, you can optioanlly
                   upgrade the station as normal, then move your engine any
                   number of spaces backwards (minimum of 1) and gain $3. If this
                   backward move ends on a train station, you can upgrade it,
                   even if you upgraded the final station.

                 * Gain one objective card: Choose one of the 4 face-up objective
                   cards or draw the top objective card from the deck. Place this
                   card in your discard pile. Replenish the face-up objectives if
                   needed.

                    If you have an objective in your hand on your turn, you can play
                   it to immediately gain the reward shown on the card. Remember,
                   by playing it, you must either fulfill the objective at the end
                   of the game or lose points.

                 * Build a private building. You can either place a new building with
                   a value not more than the number of builders you have, or upgrade
                   a prevoius building with a value difference not higher than the
                   number of builders (return the old building to the box)

                    For each builder used, you must also pay $2.

                 * Perform one single or double [auxiliary action](#aux_actions).

                 * Collect bounty for outlaws: Remove one outlaw tile of your choice
                   from the board, and collect the reward shown above that tile.

                 * Gain an exchange token: Gain an exchange token from the supply.
                   Exchange tokens can be spent at **any time** to draw up to 2 
                   cards from your personal stack, then discard the same number
                   of cards.

                 * Remove a hazard: Remove one hazard tile of your choice from any
                   hazard section and place it near your player board. If the action
                   shows a cost next to it, you must pay the cost before taking
                   the hazard tile.

                 * Move your herder forward: Move your herder at least 1 step and
                   not more than the number shown on the action. After moving,
                   you must then perform the steps of Phase B again. Any actions 
                   not yet used on the previous space are forfeit.
