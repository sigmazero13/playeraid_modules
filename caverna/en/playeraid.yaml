              ## Game Boards
                * Place the two single-sided basic game boards with Round spaces
                  1-3 and 4-12 next to each other. These are both marked "1-7" at
                  the top of the boards.
                * Shuffle the Harvest markers and place them face-down (grey rune)
                  on Round spaces 6-12, one per space.
                    * 2-player: remove one "green leaf" Harvest marker first, and
                      leave space 9 empty when placing the rest.
                * Place the "Harvest events" card near the boards.
                * Place the third basic game board to the left of the other two,
                  turned to the appropriate side based on number of players
                  (1-3 or 4-7).
                * If playing with 5-7 players, place the larger additional board,
                  turned to the approrpiate side (5, or 6-7), to the left of the
                  other boards.
                * If playing with 3 or 7 players, place the smaller additional board,
                  turned to the appropriate side (3 or 7), to the left of the other
                  boards.
              
              ## Supply Boards
                * Place the supply boards near the other boards, chosen sides up.
                    * One side is for the introductory game, the other for the full
                      game.
                * Place the Furnishing tiles on the appropriate spaces.
                    * Place a stack of ordinary "Dwelling" tiles on the marked space,
                      setting the rest aside as a reserve if needed.

              ## Action Space Cards
                * Shuffle the 12 Action space cards, face-down.
                    * 2-player: remove the "Exploration" card with the "Level 4
                      expedition" before shuffling.  Cover the Round 9 space with
                      a "Skip Round 9" Dwarf card
                    * Solo: Instead of shuffling the cards, place the cards face
                      down on the game board as follows:
                        1. Blacksmithing
                        2. Sheep farming
                        3. Ore mine construction
                        4. Wish for children
                        5. Donkey farming
                        6. Ruby mine construction
                        7. Ore delivery
                        8. Family life
                        9. "Skip round 9" card
                        10. Ore trading
                        11. Adventure
                        12. Ruby delivery
                * Sort the stack as follows:
                    * Put the 3 stage 4 cards on the bottom
                    * Put the 3 stage 3 cards on the stack
                    * Put the 2 ordinary stage 2 cards on the stack
                    * Place the "Wish for Children/Urgent Wish for Children" card
                      on the stack
                    * Place the 3 stage 1 cards on top

              ## Landscape tiles and other components
                * Sort the landscape tiles by type into separate stacks.
                * Separate the other components by type into separate piles.
                    * Weapon counters do not need to be sorted by number, except
                      for ease of finding them.

                    Turn over the next action card and put it on the next empty
                    Roundspace.  If there is a Harvest marker on the space, flip
                    it over as well.

                      * Solo and 2-player: Skip Round 9 entirely and go straight
                        to Round 10
                      * Round 4: Place the "Wish for Children" card face-up onto
                        this space.
                      * "Family Life": When this card is placed, also flip the
                        "Wish for Children" card to "Urgent Wish for Children".

                  text: |
                    For any Action spaces with a circle and and arrow, place
                    the indicated number of goods onto the card.  If there
                    are two numbers, place the larger number if there are no
                    resources on the card; otherwise, place the smaller number.

                      * Example: Logging has a circle with 3 (1) wood.  If there
                        is already wood on the card, only place 1 additional wood.
                        If the card is empty, place 3 wood on the card.

                    All goods come from the general supply.  There is no limit
                    to the number of goods that can be on the card.  Use the
                    multiplication markers if necessary.

                      * Solo: Before replenishing a space, if there are already 
                        more than 6 goods on the card, remove all goods on the
                        card and return them to the supply.  Then replenish as
                        normal. You can prevent this by spending 1 Ruby per
                        card you wish to preserve for that round.

                      * 2-Player: The Ruby mining space does not begin to accumulate
                        rubies until Round 3, as shown on the space.

                    Beginning with the Starting player and going clockwise, players
                    take turns placing Dwarfs. Take a single Dwarf from your cave
                    and place it on an **unoccupied** Action space.  Carry out the
                    depicted action immediately.  Play continues until all Dwarfs of
                    all players have been placed.

                    If you have some Dwarfs with weapons, you must place Dwarfs with
                    weapons first; then, Dwarfs with lower-numbered weapons must be
                    placed before higher-numbered weapons. You may spend a Ruby to
                    place a Dwarf out-of-order.

                    Wood, Stone, Ore, Grain, Vegetable, Food and Rubies are placed in
                    front of you in your supply.  Animals must be placed on your
                    Home Board (see Animal Husbandry).  Animals can be converted to
                    Food immediately.

                    You must take at least one of the actions on the card you place
                    the Dwarf on.

                    If a card says "either ... or" you must choose one of the actions
                    shown.  If a card says "and/or" or "and then/or", you can do
                    any or all of the actions shown.  If it says "and then", you must
                    do the actions in the specified order; otherwise, you can choose
                    the order.

                    Remove your Dwarfs from the game boards and return them to their
                    Dwellings.  Each Dwarf must have an available room.  Other than
                    that, it doesn't matter where you put them.

                - name: 5) Harvest time
                  text: |
                    Look at the icon of the current Round space's Harvest token (or
                    pre-printed icon).  If there is no icon, skip this phase.  If
                    there is a "red question mark", place the token on the top-most
                    empty space of the Harvest Event card, and resolve the effect
                    shown.

                    If there is a "green leaf", perform the following harvest sub-phases:

                      1. **The Field Phase**. Remove 1 Grain or Vegetable token from each
                         sown Field on your Home board and place it in your supply.
                      2. **The Feeding Phase**. You must pay 2 Food per Dwarf in your cave.
                         If the Dwarf was just added *during that round*, only pay 1 Food
                         for that Dwarf.  If you do not have enough Food, you may convert
                         goods into Food, or take 1 Begging marker for each Food you did
                         not pay.
                      3. **The Breeding Phase**. If you have at least 2 Farm animals of the
                         same type, you take exactly 1 additional animal of that type and
                         add it to your Home board. If you cannot accommodate it, you cannot
                         convert it to Food.  All new animals are gained at the same time.
                           * Dogs are not considered Farm animals and do not breed.
                           * It doesn't matter where the "parent" animals are on your board.

                    Placed from "Excavation", "Drift mining", "Clearing", 
                    "Sustenance", and "Slash-and-burn".  Take the depicted
                    twin tile and place it so it fully covers 2 empty spaces
                    in your Mountain or Forest. They cannot overlap other tiles,
                    or go off the board (unless you have a Furnishing that
                    allows otherwise).

                    If you cover a space with a Food or Boar icon, immediately
                    take the depicted goods.

                    Tiles must be placed adjacent to an existing tile (including
                    the pre-printed tiles).
                - name: Sow
                  text: |
                    Take a Grain or Vegetable, and place it in an emtpy Field
                    on your board.  If it is Grain, place 2 additional Grain
                    from the general supply on top of it; if it is a Vegetable,
                    place 1 additional Vegetable from the general supply on top.

                    With 1 "Sow" action, you can plant up to 2 Grain and/or 2
                    Vegetables with one action.

                    Take a Dwarf from your personal supply and place it on top
                    of the Dwarf taking this action.  You must have an available
                    Dwelling to do this (i.e., have enough so that during Phase 4
                    you can accommodate each Dwarf in your Cave.)

                    This Dwarf cannot be used this round. When feeding Dwarfs,
                    you only need to pay 1 Food for the new Dwarf this round.

                    You cannot normally have more than 5 Dwarfs.

                    Choose one of the available Furnishings, pay the building
                    costs shown, and place the Furnishing on an empty Cavern in
                    your Mountain.  You must have an available Cavern to use
                    this action.  Furnishings cannot be placed on a Tunnel,
                    Mine, or empty Mountain space.  Once place, a Furnishing
                    cannot be removed or built over.

                    Except for the ordinary Dwelling, there is only one copy of
                    each Dwelling.  Ordinary Dwellings are meant to be unlimited.

                    If the action says "Furnish a dwelling", follow these same
                    rules, except only Dwellings may be placed.
                - name: Goods
                  text: |
                    If the action shows a good with a +X next to it, take the
                    depicted number of goods from the general supply.  If there
                    are goods on the card itself, take those goods.

                    If the +X is depicted alongside a tile placement, you only
                    get the goods if you place the tile as depicted.

                    Some actions give you a number of goods for each of a
                    particular tile you have on your board.  If you have no
                    tiles of that type, you may still take the accumulated
                    goods already on the card.

                    Animals are placed on your Home board (see Animal Husbandry).
                    All other goods are placed in your personal supply.

                    may *not* place an Ore mine tile on top of a Deep tunnel

                    In addition to gaining Gold as normal, you may gain 1 of
                    each of the types of tokens shown by exchanging the specified
                    amount of Gold.  You can spend any Gold you have, and do
                    not have to spend all you are able to.  Animals gained may
                    be converted to Food immediately.

                    You may get "change" for higher-denominations of Gold.

                    Spend the amount of Wood shown to place a small or large
                    pasture tile on top of 1 or 2 Meadow spaces on your board.
                    You cannot combine or split up existing Pasture tiles.

                    Spend 1 Stone to place a Stable on a Forest, Meadow, or
                    Pasture space.  If a Forest becomes a Meador, or a Meadow
                    becomes a Pasture, the Stable remains in that space.

                    Once placed a Stable cannot be moved or removed.  Placing
                    a Stable in the Forest does not trigger gaining Food or
                    Boars.

                    with the specified value on top of the unarmed Dwarf taking
                    this action.  If the Dwarf is already armed, this action is
                    not used; you cannot use it to "upgrade" their weapon.

                    Gain loot, based on the level of Expedition shown in the
                    action and the strength of the weapon the placed Dwarf has.
                    Unarmed Dwarfs cannot use this action.

                    On the Expedition loot Overview card, you will find a list of
                    loot you can gain.  You can gain any loot with a depicted weapon
                    strength less than or equal to your Dwarf's weapon strength.
                    You may take a number of loot (following this restriction) equal
                    to the level of Expedition, but you cannot take the same exact
                    loot twice for the same action (but can take two different loot
                    with the same minimum weapon strength).

                    Goods are taken as normal.

                    The "after Expedition all Weapons +1" will give ALL your armed
                    Dwarfs +1 to their weapon strenth (including the Dwarf used for
                    the Expedition).

                    Tiles or actions chosen must be placed or resolved immediately.

                    Breeding animals requires you to have at least 2 of that type
                    of animal.

                    After collecting the chosen loot, the Dwarf taking this action
                    increases their weapon strength by 1 (or 2, if the "Weapon +1"
                    loot was taken.)

                    Take the Starting Player marker.  You will be the Starting player
                    beginning next round.  This is the only way the Starting player
                    marker will change hands.
                - name: Imitation
                    Pay the indicated food, and take the action of another occupied
                    space, as if your Dwarf was placed there.  Do not place your
                    Dwarf on the chosen space.

                    The Starting Player space cannot be chosen by this action, nor
                    can a space occupied by one of your own Dwarfs.

              Rubies are sort of a "wild" good, and can be used for many
              things.  One of the Overview cards shows a full list of how
              you can use them.  You can do this at any time during your turn.

                * You can spend 1 ruby to gain 1 of any of the following:

                  * Dog
                  * Sheep
                  * Donkey
                  * Boar
                  * Wheat
                  * Vegetable
                  * Wood
                  * Stone
                  * Ore
                  * Small Meadow tile
                  * Small Field tile
                  * Small Tunnel tile

                * You can spend 1 ruby and 1 Food to gain 1 Cattle.

                * You can spend 2 rubies to gain a Small Cavern tile.

                * You can spend 1 ruby to place an Armed Dwarf out-of-order

                * Solo: You can spend 1 ruby to prevent a card with more than
                  6 resources from being cleared.

              Tiles gained must be placed onto an empty Forest or Mountain
              space on your board immediately, adjacent to another tile.

            text: |
              You must have enough space on your board to place all the Farm animals
              you gain.  Dogs do not have to have space on your Board.  The following
              spaces can hold animals:
              
                * The Entry-level Dwelling on your board can hold 2 Farm animals of
                  the same type.
                * The "Breakfast Room" Furnishing tile can hold up to 3 Cattle.
                * Each Ore or Ruby mine space can hold 1 Donkey
                * A Meadow with a Stable can hold 1 of any Farm animal.
                * Meadows cannot normally hold Farm animals. However, if you place
                  1 or more Dogs on a Meadow, you can place Sheep on that space equal
                  to the number of Dogs + 1 (eg., with 2 Dogs you can have 3 Sheep).
                  If you do this in a Meadow with a Stable, the Stable is ignored.
                * Each Pasture space can hold up to 2 Farm animals of the same type.
                  A twin Pasture tile can hold up to 4 Farm animals of the same type.
                * A Stable inside a Pasture increases the amount of Farm animals of
                  the same type the Pasture can hold.
                    * A small Pasture with a Stable can hold 4 Farm animals.
                    * A large Pasture with a Stable can hold 8 Farm animals.
                    * A large Pasture with a stable can hold 16 Farm animals.

            text: |
              Certain goods can be converted to food as depcted at the bottom of your
              Home board:

                * Dogs cannot be converted to Food
                * Donkeys, Sheep, and Grain can be converted to 1 Food each
                * Boars, Rubies, and Vegetables can be converted to 2 Food each
                * Cattle can be converted to 3 Food each
                * 2 Donkeys can be converted to 3 Food for each pair.
                * 2-4 Gold can be spent to gain Food equal to the amount spent -1.
                  (eg., 2 Gold for 1 food).  1 Gold does not give you any Food.
